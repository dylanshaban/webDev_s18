I've set out to build a site for Otto's Tacos. We want to have our own propriatery delivery service to be the centerpiece of our new website, so that's what you get above the fold. 

the site is live hosted here:

The client, Otto, wants a one scroll experience, super simple and to the point that gets you ordering or in the door. He said to me that people aren't going to restaurant websites anymore unless it's to order. So, why have any unnecessary information on there. There's a lot more to do, but in time it'll look and function all the better. 

I used bootstrap, css, and javascript. I used the scrolling nav platform from bootstrap and took some css from the current Otto's site, mashed them together with some stuff we learned in class like modals and column positioning and some stuff from out of class like google maps and markers. 

Hope ya like it!
